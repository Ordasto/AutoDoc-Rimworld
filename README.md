# Programming Stuff for those that care
The source and assembly are from diffrent versions ( before the 1.3 fix ) because either:
A: I was tired when i pushed this (most likley)
B: Github fucked me raw and only pushed some of it.
## Fix
so i've manually fixed it but i can't guarentee that if you compile the source yourself that it will work
the rest should be fine though
