# AutoDoc-Rimworld 
Auto Doc for Rimworld 

Adds an AutoDoc for rimworld <br/>
It's intended for Solo colonists that still want to use bionics <br/>
Will tend wounds and infections and 
do surgry if required materials for surgry are in adjacent cells 


# Programming Stuff
The source and assembly are from diffrent versions ( before the 1.3 fix ) because either: <br/>
A: I was tired when i pushed this (most likley) <br/>
B: Github fucked me raw and only pushed some of it. 
## Fix 
so i've manually fixed it but i can't guarentee that if you compile the source yourself that it will work 
the rest should be fine though
